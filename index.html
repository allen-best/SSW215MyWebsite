                <p>Allen pursues a Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering. He believes this is possible with previous hands-on experience through small projects and FIRST robotics. He enjoys being challenged and working on projects that require him to work outside his comfort and knowledge set. He continues to learn new languages and development techniques are important to him. He is currently seeking an internship or research opportunity that will allow him to utilize his problem-solving skills and attention to detail to further develop his abilities in the field of Software Engineering.<span id="dots">...</span></p>
                <p id="more">As an undergraduate Software Engineering student, He plans to grow up doing something He's very passionate in. As of right now He's very invested into getting his web development skills better. After being profficient in web development, he would like to transfer those skills to app development. Ever since he was younger, He's always had a niche for technology whether it was playing with his parents computer, playing video games or using a variety of different apps. Now, He realizes he really loves programming and this helped him decide to study Software Engineering and He's only been motivated to learn more and work harder. For my short term goal, I hope to keep growing to possibly become a Senior Software Engineer for a well known company. After this I hope to grow into more of a managenment goal. For my long term goal, I hope to one day run my own software business. I know that for this to happen I will need to know the business side as well making this major even more approachable. </p>

                <p id="margin-fix">Stevens will become a premier student-centric technological research university, focusing on six “foundational pillars,” areas of true societal need where Stevens possesses significant depth and expertise: artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cybersecurity; data science and information systems; complex systems and networks; financial systems and technologies; biomedical engineering, healthcare, and life sciences; and resilience and sustainability. As our education and research capacity grows in these areas, so will our influence.</p>
